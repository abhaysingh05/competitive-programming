# cpbook-code
CP4 Free Source Code Project (cpp/gnu++17, java/java11, py/python3, and ml/ocaml).

This repo is expected to be much more up-to-date than CP4 itself, that will go out to public on 19 July 2020.

All code in this repo are mostly (reasonably good, hopefully :) implementation of many well-known data structures and algorithms,
so you are free to copy, adapt, use the code (in your next programming contest or any other coding project).

Note to Computer Science educators worldwide: please include all the code discussed here in your plagiarism checker system as "excluded".
Please do NOT test your students to just (re-)code these basic data structures/algorithms verbatim as that is just reinventing the wheel.
Please test them with higher order thinking questions/problems that use these code instead.

We will be thankful if you cite us (Steven Halim, Felix Halim, Suhendry Effendy) when you use code in this repo.
